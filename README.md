# library

This is the 4th javascript project from theodinproject curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library). The aims of this project were to introduce the use of objects in a small web application.

In this project, I have managed to use objects, but not in a meaningful way. I look forwards to the coming projects to further develop my understanding of javascript objects and the surrounding techniques. This project was fairly straightforward, with the biggest challenge being found in trying to link DOM elements, my form inputs, and generating cards from my objects altogether, but it did not prove to be too difficult.

In my code, while I have successfully followed the principle of D.R.Y (don't repeat yourself), I need to take more care with my functions so that a single function does not take too much responsibility. In future projects, I will aim to follow this principle so my code is cleaner and more maintainable. I have kept the use of comments to a minimum because I believe my code to be quite self explanatory due to fairly simple code and expressive function and variable names.
